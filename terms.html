 <ol>
    <li>By booking a flight with Goose Airlines, you acknowledge and accept that our primary objective is to provide a "unique" experience that is guaranteed to get your adrenaline pumping. Please note that this experience comes with a rather interesting 78% fatality rate, but hey, who's counting?</li>

    <li>While we strive to maintain the highest safety standards, we cannot guarantee your survival during the flight. In fact, you are more likely to survive a round of Russian roulette than a typical Goose Airlines flight. We recommend preparing your last will and testament, just in case.</li>

    <li>Due to the inherent risks involved, passengers are required to sign a waiver acknowledging that Goose Airlines will not be held responsible for any injuries, dismemberments, or unfortunate accidents that may occur during the flight. We highly recommend taking out a life insurance policy before boarding.</li>

    <li>Please note that we do not provide refunds or compensation in the event of any injuries, loss of limbs, or, well, fatal incidents. We apologize for any inconvenience caused but remember, you signed the waiver! Yikes!</li>

    <li>In-flight entertainment may include an intense game of "Find the Loose Bolt" or a riveting competition of "Who Can Scream the Loudest." Keep in mind that Goose Airlines is not liable for any emotional distress or trauma resulting from these activities.</li>

    <li>In the unlikely event of a successful landing, passengers are advised to be cautious when exiting the aircraft, as there is a 22% chance of encountering wild geese or other unforeseen obstacles on the runway. We recommend carrying a large stick or a bag of birdseed for self-defense purposes.</li>

    <li>Our flight attendants are trained to provide minimal assistance during emergencies, so please don't rely on them too much. In case of an actual emergency, remember to scream loudly and brace for impact. It won't help, but hey, it's worth a try!</li>

    <li>Goose Airlines reserves the right to substitute its aircraft with a large, angry goose or any other unconventional mode of transportation at any time. We like to keep things interesting and unpredictable, so buckle up and prepare for the ride of your life!</li>
 </ol>

By proceeding with your booking, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and are ready to face the absurdity and unpredictability that Goose Airlines has to offer. Safe (well, sort of) travels!
