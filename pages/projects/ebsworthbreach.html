            <p>
                This report will focus on the HWL Ebsworth (HWLE) data breach in April 2023, the victim HWLE is one
                of the largest legal partnerships in Australia which provides services to many government entities
                (<a href="#4">Bernardone 2024</a>). As this situation is still unfolding the timeline listed below is only accurate to the
                release of this report.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>28th of April 2023 – HWLE discovers attack, after the threat actor (APLHV) makes an online
                post claiming to of exfiltrated data (<a href="#10">HWL Ebsworth c. 2023</a>).</li>
                <li>1st of May 2023 – HWLE reports a cyber incident involving ransomware and data exfiltration
                (<a href="#7">Department of Customer Service 2023</a>).</li>
                <li>8th of May 2023 – HWLE provided the initial report to the OAIC due to passing the threshold
                for a notifiable data breach (<a href="#7">Department of Customer Service 2023</a>).</li>
                <li>9th of June 2023 – HWLE became aware the threat actor published 1.4TB of data
                (<a href="#7">Department of Customer Service 2023</a>).</li>
                <li>15th of June 2023 – HWLE files an injunction to prevent the ALPHV and any third parties from
                releasing any information (<a href="#9">Hendy 2023</a>).</li>
                <li>23rd of June 2023 – AIRMSHL Goldie is appointed as Australia’s first National Cyber Security
                Coordinator (NCSC) in response to the breach (<a href="#5">Borys & Al-Nashar 2023</a>).</li>
                <li>18th of September 2023 – The NCSC publicly states 65 government agencies were impacted
                by the breach (<a href="#8">Department of Home Affairs 2023</a>, p. 2)</li>
                <li>20th of December 2023 – The Federal Bureau of Investigation releases a decryption tool in
                partnership with the Australian Federal Police (<a href=#2>Australian Federal Police 2023</a>).</li>
                <li>15th of January 2024 – The Department of Home Affairs releases a list from October detailing
                62 affected government departments and entities and the information breached (<a href="#4">Bernardone 2024</a>; <a href="#8">Department of Home Affairs 2023</a>).</li>
            </ul>

            <p> 
                Unfortunately, the exact vulnerability that was exploited has not been publicly disclosed, however, it
                was reported that the attackers achieved network access to a file server via an email an employee
                had received on their personal device (<a href="#6">Buckingham-Jones & Pelly 2023</a>; <a href="#11">Mason & Pelly 2023</a>). While
                the source of the information cannot be directly confirmed, a 2022 Ransomware profile on ALPHV
                notes that their primary access vector is through utilizing valid login credentials, either brute forced
                or gained in phishing attacks to access commercial RDP and VPN products (Australian Cyber Security
                Centre 2022, pp. 2-3). With this information, it can be inferred that the attack was potentially caused
                by a phishing email sent to an employee’s personal email, which then provided the attacker with
                valid credentials to gain network access via a VPN on the employee’s device. After this point there is
                less pertinent evidence on this specific attack, meaning the following is more speculative based on a
                <a href="#13">Microsoft Threat Intelligence (2022)</a> report which identifies the ALPHZ ransomware as being capable
                of a user authenticated privilege escalation via a UAC bypass, followed by encryption and data
                exfiltration notably the exfiltration process can take several days.
            </p>
            <p>
                However we can utilize the profile developed by the (<a href="#1">ACSC 2022</a>) to understand who ALPHV are, and
                what their next actions may have been. To begin with ALPHV is also known as BlackCat and are
                Russian-speaking group that provides a ransomware-as-a-service affiliate program. Of which is a
                business model that allows people to pay to use the ransomware with a monthly fee model and a percentage of profits from the attack (<a href="#3">Baker 2023</a>). ALPHV are believed to be tied to the groups
                responsible for the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack (<a href="#1">ACSC 2022</a>, p. 1). And the primary
                initial access methods employed by the users of this software are exploiting known vulnerabilities,
                common security misconfigurations, and stolen credentials (<a href="#1">ACSC 2022</a>, p. 2).
            </p>
            <p>
                This information is quite useful as it shows that ALPHV primarily uses known vulnerabilities and
                common misconfigurations. Both of which can be effectively mitigated through auditing systems for
                publicly known vulnerabilities and then correcting them. And then auditing configurations for issues
                such as default accounts, services with unnecessarily exposed ports, and lack of security hardening
                (<a href="#16">OWASP 2021</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                The difficult issue to address with the exploitation of valid accounts is the human element.
                <a href="#12">Menachem et al. (2023)</a> suggests multiple mitigation methods, however the easiest to apply in this
                situation would be restricting the use of personal devices, ensuring suitable password policies are in
                place with periodical changes, Account auditing based on their activity, and most importantly. User
                Training, without sufficient training the attack will have a high chance of reoccurring.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally to improve the defense in depth, changes should be made to Remote access services.
                <a href="#15">Oliveira et al. (2023)</a> advises four primary methods to mitigate this the first is to disable remote
                access services, limiting remote access to sensitive information, applying Multi-factor Authentication,
                and network segmentation through internal firewalls and gateways so clients cannot access the full
                network remotely.
            </p>
            <p>
                The breach itself is reported to of affected a majority of HWLE’s clientele with approximately 4Tb of
                documents being leaked which has included at least 62 different government departments and
                agencies (<a href="#4">Bernardone 2024</a>; <a href="#8">DHA 2023</a>). Affected entities range from the Digital Health Agency
                responsible for the My Health Record, through to the Department of Defence. An overview was
                provided stating a range of PII, Medical, and National security information among many others were
                exfiltrated (<a href="#8">DHA 2023</a>, p. 4).
            </p>
            <p>
                A notable response by HWLE was to file a legal injunction to prevent ALPHV from illegally releasing
                data that was illegally acquired the side effect of this however is that media companies and third
                party breach detection services such as HaveIBeenPwned are unable to report directly on this
                information (<a href="#9">Hendy 2023</a>). While this has helped to protect the reputation of HWLE it comes at a
                cost to affected individuals who have been notified they were involved in a breach but not what
                information had been breached (<a href="#14">Nadel J 2024</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                To conclude, this breach could have been mitigated through adequate security measures. The threat
                actors were known for using already reported vulnerabilities. But most critically the information of
                the breaches was suppressed, rightfully so with the security agencies. But at the detriment of the
                individuals who have had sensitive information breached from health-related agencies but have not
                been told what information was breached. And hopefully this situation is used as a future learning
                experience on how to respond to large breaches.
